Sources of ionising radiation i.e. radioactive substances, instruments and equipment capable of emitting radiation, must only be used if there is no safer alternative. Use of ionising radiation must be justified.<br/><br/>Risks associated with use of ionising radiation and radioactive substances must be managed in accordance with legal requirements and management control principles.<br/>If use of ionising radiation cannot be avoided and is justified, exposure to ionising radiations must be restricted in accordance with “as low as reasonably practicable” (ALARP). This is achieved by an assessment of the risk of harm to individuals’ health from exposure to radiation. If an unacceptable level of risk is identified, measures must be put in place which minimise the risk in line with the ALARP principle.<br/><br/>Ionising radiation includes X-rays, gamma rays and particulate radiation (alpha, beta and neutron radiation) produced from X-ray sets or radioactive substances. They are typically used in medical exposures, industrial radiography equipment and gauges used for process control, but may also be produced from naturally occurring radioactive substances, including radon gas.<br/><br/>Our organisation has appointed external competent advice from a radiation protection adviser (RPA) - this is a legal requirement when working with ionising radiation. Additionally our RPA offers internal training regarding ionising radiation please review your internal intranet for more information.<br/><br/>The health and safety team act as Radiation Protection Officer (RPO) and assist in radiation safety and compliance matters.<br/><br/> Those with management responsibility must identify all sources of ionising radiation that their employees could be exposed to including radon gas. This is naturally occurring and may be present in your workplace, even if you don’t do any other work with radiation.<br/><br/>Ensure appropriate shielding and personal protective equipment is used to reduce exposure when working with ionising radiation.",
